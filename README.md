## About the project

I am a sound artist and interested in archiving sound of physical spaces in forms of impulse responses in a common respository.
I am constantly adding convolution reverb for places that I record in. 

I have made this app for anyone to be able to experience the sound of these spaces. It connects to your browser microphone. 
Be sure to use headphones or a sound setup to avoid a feedback loop.

I used some data from [https://openairlib.net](https://openairlib.net), a project from the university of york and EchoThief impulse response library. 

I am currently setting up a process for anyone to be able to add an impulse response for a place to the respository. If you would like to do that now, you could mail me at [jayantmanchanda1@gmail.com](jayantmanchanda1@gmail.com)
